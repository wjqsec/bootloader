    *** Release 7.5.0 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 7.4.1:

    New features:
        - Limine boot protocol: Add support for requests start marker, to
          complement the previously called delimiter, now renamed to "end
          marker".

          compared to base revision 1 being that it mandates bootloaders to
          support request delimiters.

    Bug fixes:
        - Fix an issue regarding commit date parsing in the bootstrap script.

    Miscellaneous:
        - General documentation updates and improvements; split USAGE.md from

    Bug fixes:
        - multiboot2 protocol: Do not panic if there is a ENTRY_ADDRESS_EFI64

    Bug fixes:
        - Fix ARM64/aarch64 spinup code to properly support Apple Silicon
          chips.
        - Prevent users from building Limine with a GNU Make version older than
          4.2, as that is not supported, by gracefully erroring out with a
          useful error message.
        - Avoid usage of reserved C identifiers in certain cases.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Drop usage of "libgcc-binaries" for "cc-runtime". This finally makes
          us able to ship Limine tarballs without included binary blobs, and
          should improve compatibility with more obscure toolchain set ups.
