#### Settings folder
In this folder is grouped all what deals with "settings".
By settings, I mean :
  - user settings (for example plist files)
  - discovered charateristics (for example hardware, mac address, etc.)
  - live state (currently represented by GlobalConfig and scattered globals variables).

2021-04: work in progress. Not all are in there yet.
