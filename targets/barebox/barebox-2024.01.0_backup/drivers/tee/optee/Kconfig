	help
	  This driver implements bidirectional communication with the OP-TEE
	  Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). OP-TEE is a Trusted OS designed
	  primarily to rely on the ARM TrustZone(R) technology as the
	  underlying hardware isolation mechanism.
	  This driver can request services from OP-TEE, but doesn't
	  yet provide a supplicant to handle Remote Procedure Calls (RPC).
	  For more information see: https://www.op-tee.org

	  This driver doesn't actually load OP-TEE. For that see
	  CONFIG_BOOTM_OPTEE and PBL_OPTEE.

	  If unsure, say n here.

	bool "Provide /dev/tee0 interface"
	depends on OPTEE && FS_DEVFS && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Userspace accesses OP-TEE via ioctls and mmaps of the /dev/tee0
	  device. This are no current in-tree users of this interface,
	  but it's useful for compiling libteeclient + optee_tests for
	  use inside barebox to verify proper operation of CONFIG_OPTEE.
