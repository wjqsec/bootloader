	  Generic RTC class support. If you say yes here, you will

	  If you say yes here you get support for various compatible RTC
	  chips (often with battery backup) connected with I2C. This driver
	  should handle DS1307, DS1338 and probably other chips.

	  The first seven registers on these chips hold an RTC, and other
	  registers may add features such as NVRAM, a trickle charger for
	  the RTC/NVRAM backup power, and alarms.
