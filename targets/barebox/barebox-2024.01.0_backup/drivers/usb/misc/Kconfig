	  This option enables support for configuration via SMBus of the
	  Microchip USB251x/xBi USB 2.0 Hub Controller series. Configuration
	  parameters may be set in devicetree or platform data.
	  Say Y or M here if you need to configure such a device via SMBus.

config USB_ONBOARD_HUB
	bool "Onboard USB hub support"
	depends on OFDEVICE || COMPILE_TEST
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to support discrete onboard USB hubs that
	  don't require an additional control bus for initialization, but
	  need some non-trivial form of initialization, such as enabling a
	  power regulator. An example for such a hub is the Realtek
	  RTS5411.
