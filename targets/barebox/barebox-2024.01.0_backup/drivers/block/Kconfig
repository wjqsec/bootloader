          QEMU based VMMs (like KVM or Xen).

	  EFI block devices will be normally called /dev/diskX. Setting this
	  option will cause block devices instantiated from handles with a
	  EFI_USB_IO protocol to be called /dev/usbdiskX instead. Note that
	  some buggy UEFI implementations have been observed to not do this
	  consistently for all USB mass storage. If you need to absolutely
	  be sure your boot device is a USB mass storage device and you can't
	  fix your UEFI, consider disabling this options and setting a GUID
	  for your disk and checking against it with

	    devlookup -v $bootguid /dev/disk$bootsource_instance guid
