	help
	  For beeping on PCM sound cards, barebox needs to synthesize samples,
	  which can take too much poller time for crisp playback and/or quick
	  booting. If your playback stutters, say Y here. This will have all
	  synthesizers output a gain-adjusted square wave instead, which is
	  less time-consuming to compute.
