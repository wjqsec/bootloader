 * @master: Copy of controller, for backwards compatibility
 * @max_speed_hz: Maximum clock rate to be used with this chip
 *	(on this board); may be changed by the device's driver.
 *	The spi_transfer.speed_hz can override this for each transfer.
 * @chip_select: Chipselect, distinguishing chips handled by @controller.
 * @mode: The spi mode defines how data is clocked out and in.
 *	This may be changed by the device's driver.
 *	The "active low" default for chipselect mode can be overridden
 *	(by specifying SPI_CS_HIGH) as can the "MSB first" default for
 *	each word in a transfer (by specifying SPI_LSB_FIRST).
 * @bits_per_word: Data transfers involve one or more words; word sizes
 *	like eight or 12 bits are common.  In-memory wordsizes are
 *	powers of two bytes (e.g. 20 bit samples use 32 bits).
 *	This may be changed by the device's driver, or left at the
 *	default (0) indicating protocol words are eight bit bytes.
 *	The spi_transfer.bits_per_word can override this for each transfer
 *	(FIXME: not currently implemented by most drivers).
 * @irq: Negative, or the number passed to request_irq() to receive
 *	interrupts from this device.
 * @controller_state: Controller's runtime state
 * @controller_data: Board-specific definitions for controller, such as
 *	FIFO initialization parameters; from board_info.controller_data
 * @modalias: Name of the driver to use with this device, or an alias
 *	for that name.  This appears in the sysfs "modalias" attribute
 *	for driver coldplugging, and in uevents used for hotplugging
 *
 * A @spi_device is used to interchange data between an SPI slave
 * (usually a discrete chip) and CPU memory.
 *
 * In @dev, the platform_data is used to hold information about this
 * device that's meaningful to the device's protocol driver, but not
 * to its controller.  One example might be an identifier for a chip
 * variant with slightly different functionality; another might be
 * information about how this particular board wires the chip's pins.

/*
 * I/O INTERFACE between SPI controller and protocol drivers
 *
 * Protocol drivers use a queue of spi_messages, each transferring data
 * between the controller and memory buffers.
 *
 * The spi_messages themselves consist of a series of read+write transfer
 * segments.  Those segments always read the same number of bits as they
 * write; but one or the other is easily ignored by passing a null buffer
 * pointer.  (This is unlike most types of I/O API, because SPI hardware
 * is full duplex.)
 *
 * NOTE:  Allocation of spi_transfer and spi_message memory is entirely
 * up to the protocol driver, which guarantees the integrity of both (as
 * well as the data buffers) for as long as the message is queued.
 */

/**
 * struct spi_transfer - a read/write buffer pair
 * @tx_buf: data to be written (dma-safe memory), or NULL
 * @rx_buf: data to be read (dma-safe memory), or NULL
 * @len: size of rx and tx buffers (in bytes)
 * @speed_hz: Select a speed other then the device default for this
 *      transfer. If 0 the default (from @spi_device) is used.
 * @bits_per_word: select a bits_per_word other then the device default
 *      for this transfer. If 0 the default (from @spi_device) is used.
 * @cs_change: affects chipselect after this transfer completes
 * @delay_usecs: microseconds to delay after this transfer before
 *	(optionally) changing the chipselect status, then starting
 *	the next transfer or completing this @spi_message.
 * @transfer_list: transfers are sequenced through @spi_message.transfers
 *
 * SPI transfers always write the same number of bytes as they read.
 * Protocol drivers should always provide @rx_buf and/or @tx_buf.
 *
 * If the transmit buffer is null, zeroes will be shifted out
 * while filling @rx_buf.  If the receive buffer is null, the data
 * shifted in will be discarded.  Only "len" bytes shift out (or in).
 * It's an error to try to shift out a partial word.  (For example, by
 * shifting out three bytes with word size of sixteen or twenty bits;
 * the former uses two bytes per word, the latter uses four bytes.)
 *
 * In-memory data values are always in native CPU byte order, translated
 * from the wire byte order (big-endian except with SPI_LSB_FIRST).  So
 * for example when bits_per_word is sixteen, buffers are 2N bytes long
 * (@len = 2N) and hold N sixteen bit words in CPU byte order.
 *
 * When the word size of the SPI transfer is not a power-of-two multiple
 * of eight bits, those in-memory words include extra bits.  In-memory
 * words are always seen by protocol drivers as right-justified, so the
 * undefined (rx) or unused (tx) bits are always the most significant bits.
 *
 * All SPI transfers start with the relevant chipselect active.  Normally
 * it stays selected until after the last transfer in a message.  Drivers
 * can affect the chipselect signal using cs_change.
 *
 * (i) If the transfer isn't the last one in the message, this flag is
 * used to make the chipselect briefly go inactive in the middle of the
 * message.  Toggling chipselect in this way may be needed to terminate
 * a chip command, letting a single spi_message perform all of group of
 * chip transactions together.
 *
 * (ii) When the transfer is the last one in the message, the chip may
 * stay selected until the next transfer.  On multi-device SPI busses
 * with nothing blocking messages going to other devices, this is just
 * a performance hint; starting a message to another device deselects
 * this one.  But in other cases, this can be used to ensure correctness.
 * Some devices need protocol transactions to be built from a series of
 * spi_message submissions, where the content of one message is determined
 * by the results of previous messages and where the whole transaction
 * ends when the chipselect goes intactive.
 *
 * The code that submits an spi_message (and its spi_transfers)
 * to the lower layers is responsible for managing its memory.
 * Zero-initialize every field you don't set up explicitly, to
 * insulate against future API updates.  After you submit a message
 * and its transfers, ignore them until its completion callback.
