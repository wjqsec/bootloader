Texas Instruments K3
====================

K3 is for Keystone 3 and denotes a family of SoCs from Texas Instruments. From these
SoCs the AM62x is currently supported under barebox. The boot flow needs several images,
only the last stage is supported by barebox. To start up the help of U-Boot is still
needed.

The board currently supported by barebox is the BeaglePlay board, see
https://www.beagleboard.org/boards/beagleplay. The following examples assume
this board is used.

Building barebox
----------------
.. code-block:: sh

  make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=<ARM toolchain prefix> multi_v8_defconfig

Running barebox
---------------

barebox can be started from running U-Boot with:

.. code-block:: sh

  dhcp 0x82000000 <serverip>:barebox-beagleplay.img; bootm 0x82000000

To start barebox from SD/eMMC replace the ``u-boot.img`` on a bootable SD/eMMC card
with the content of ``images/barebox-beagleplay-fit.img``
