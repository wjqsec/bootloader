# Introduction

This tutorial will introduce you to the [kAFL](https://github.com/IntelLabs/kAFL) fuzzer, by walking you through the necessary steps
to setup the fuzzer on your machine, configure our prepared fuzzing targets (Linux kernel, Windows userspace and driver),
find the inserted vulnerabilities and analyzing the results.

At the end of the tutorial you should have been able to find a few bugs, understand their root cause, have a better understanding of the overall kAFL setup and user interface, and be able to adapt kAFL to your targets using our reference documentation and how-to guides.

We assume you are an advanced Linux user, comfortable with the shell, Git, booting your machine on a new kernel and able to grasp [the changes](../reference/deployment.md) made by the installer onto your machine.

Let's now jump to the [installation](./installation.md) section ! ðŸ“¦
